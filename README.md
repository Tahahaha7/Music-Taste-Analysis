# Music_Taste_Analysis
Analyzing audio features from my personal Spotify data. Initially the analysis focuses of the top 100 streamed songs and the patterns that their characteristics have in common. Another section is dedicated to tracking the frequency of streaming for each song as well as the time of the day it was played.
This small project is meant to test my usual claim that I listen to a wide variety of music, examine the evolution of my taste in music, and it would also surve as a reference for predicting the probability of enjoying new songs.


## Exploring the data

Streming frequency and time.
